## Topics
- Authentication
- Authorization


## User Stories

1. As a registered user, I should be able to log in by providing my username (no passwords for today)
- does the schema need to change?

- what routes(s) do i need?

> When I submit this login form...,
find the user by their username
if that user exists, store their id in the session storage
and redirect to the students index page
otherwise, redirect to the login page


## Goals

How can I make the current user available in all of my controllers and in my views
